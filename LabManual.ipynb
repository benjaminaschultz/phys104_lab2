    "# Lab 2: Acceleration due to gravity\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we are going to measure the acceleration due to gravity $g$ by dropping a ball and constructing a motion diagram using a digital camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will measure the separation of the falling object in adjacent frames in our motion diagram, and use our knowledge of one dimensional dynamics to compute its acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "1. Select a mass to use as your falling object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In front of the blackboard, drop the mass at the when your instruction signals you\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Return to your desk and wait for the intructor to inform your that your video is ready for processing\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Follow the instructions to identify the first frame of the video to use in your motion diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Run the program to compute your motion diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Record the position of the falling object in pixels\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Use the meter stick in your image to convert from pixels to meters\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Pass your data to the fitting program to determine the objects initial velocity and its acceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Collect values from 5 other classmates and compute the standard error\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some follow up questions that follow. Complete them and submit your lab notebook.\n",

    "The instructor will help one student at a time record a video of them dropping an object in front of the black board.\n",
    "\n",

    "To get an idea of how this will proceed, Consider the digram below. You may assume the object is moving right and the adjacent snapshots are taken 2 times per second.\n",
